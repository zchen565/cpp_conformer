# Kaldi intro

all the training and inference needs shell !!!!


# Use nnet3

Is it possible to use cpp for training ?

What it needs to store the model, how to use the model on the disk ?

# Implementation
1. Conformer
2. CTC （Professor suggested speaker recoginition  CTC is complicated !）
3. Gradient Method, Initial Problem (No advanced algo in Kaldi)

I don't think I can do all, only 1 step is fine ！
